<center><pre><h3><mark style="background-color:red">Mental health includes our emotional,psychological and social well being.
    It affects how we think,feel and act.Mental health is important at every stage of life,from childhood
     and adolescence through adulthood.</mark>
<BR>
<b>Mental health is more than the absence of mental disorders.
     It exists on a complex continuum, which is experienced differently from one person to the next,
     with varying degrees of difficulty and distress and potentially very different social and clinical outcomes.</b>

<em><h1 style = "color:indianred">Early History </h1> <br></em>

<pre><h3>In the mid 19th century Williams Sweetser was  the first to coin the term mental hygiene,
    which can be seen as the precursor to comtemporary approaches to work on promoting positive mental health. 
    In American history,mentally ill patients were thought to be religiously punished.
    In the post-WWII years, references to mental hygiene were gradually replaced by the term 'mental health' due to its positive aspect that evolves from the treatment of illness to preventive and promotive areas of healthcare.

<em><h1 style = "color:lightseagreen"> Determinants of Mental Health</h1> <br></em>

<pre><h3>Individual psychological and biological factors such as emotional skills,
     substance use and genetics can make people more vulnerable to mental health problems.
    Exposure to difficult and rough childhood,hard family circumstances
     and being subjected to bullying and physical violence can trigger meantal health problems.
    Some early signs related to mental health problems are sleep irritation,
     lack of energy, lack of appetite and thinking of harming yourself or others.
</h3></pre>
<br>


<em><h1 style = "color:indianred">Biological factors affecting mental health</h1> <br></em>

<pre><h3>Biological factors include genetics, prenatal damage, infections, exposure to toxins, brain defects or injuries, and substance abuse. Many professionals believe that the cause of mental disorders is the biology of the brain and the nervous system.
    Mental disorders can develop if the pregnant mother uses drugs or alcohol or is exposed to illnesses or infections during pregnancy.  
</h3></pre>
<br>

<em><h1 style = "color:lightseagreen">The influence of our environment and our experiences on our mental health</h1><br></em>

<pre><h3>Social connections:It is important to have meaningful relationships and we are most likely to experience grief when we go through a difficult or lose a relationship.

    Health issues:Poor mental health can be caused by injuries, diseases, and other problems. Certain physical factors, such as brain injury, birth trauma, and drug abuse, can directly impact brain chemistry and lead to mental illness.

    Addiction:Poor mental health can be caused by addiction and substance abuse. Poor mental health can also lead to substance misuse and addictive behaviors. This could lead to a vicious circle.

<em><h1 style = "color:indianred">Coping with the Mental health issues</h1><br></em>

</h3></pre>Staying positive. It's important to try to have a positive outlook; some ways to do that include
Finding balance between positive and negative emotions. Staying positive doesn't mean that you never feel negative emotions, such as sadness or anger. You need to feel them so that you can move through difficult situations. They can help you to respond to a problem. But you don't want those emotions to take over. For example, it's not helpful to keep thinking about bad things that happened in the past or worry too much about the future.
Trying to hold on to the positive emotions when you have them
Taking a break from negative information. Know when to stop watching or reading the news. Use social media to reach out for support and feel connected to others but be careful. Don't fall for rumors, get into arguments, or negatively compare your life to others.
Practicing gratitude, which means being thankful for the good things in your life. It's helpful to do this every day, either by thinking about what you are grateful for or writing it down in a journal. These can be big things, such as the support you have from loved ones, or little things, such as enjoying a nice meal. It's important to allow yourself a moment to enjoy that you had the positive experience. Practicing gratitude can help you to see your life differently. For example, when you are stressed, you may not notice that there are also moments when you have some positive emotions. Gratitude can help you to recognize them.
Taking care of your physical health, since your physical and mental health are connected. Some ways to take care of your physical health include
Being physically active. Exercise can reduce feelings of stress and depression and improve your mood.
Getting enough sleep. Sleep affects your mood. If you don't get a good sleep, you may become more easily annoyed and angry. Over the long term, a lack of quality sleep can make you more likely to become depressed. So it's important to make sure that you have a regular sleep schedule and get enough quality sleep every night.
Healthy eating. Good nutrition will help you feel better physically but could also improve your mood and decrease anxiety and stress. Also, not having enough of certain nutrients may contribute to some mental illnesses. For example, there may be a link between low levels of vitamin B12 and depression. Eating a well-balanced diet can help you to get enough of the nutrients you need.
Connecting with others. Humans are social creatures, and it's important to have strong, healthy relationships with others. Having good social support may help protect you against the harms of stress. It is also good to have different types of connections. Besides connecting with family and friends, you could find ways to get involved with your community or neighborhood. For example, you could volunteer for a local organization or join a group that is focused on a hobby you enjoy.
Developing a sense of meaning and purpose in life. This could be through your job, volunteering, learning new skills, or exploring your spirituality.
Developing coping skills, which are methods you use to deal with stressful situations. They may help you face a problem, take action, be flexible, and not easily give up in solving it.
